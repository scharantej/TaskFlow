## Design of Recurring Todo Tracker Using Flask

### HTML Files

1. **base.html**:
   - This will be the base HTML layout for the application.
   - It will contain the common elements across all pages, such as the header, navigation bar, and footer.
   - It will include placeholders for specific page content.

2. **index.html**:
   - This will be the homepage for the application.
   - It will contain an overview of the recurring todo tracker, along with instructions on usage.
   - It will have a link to the recurring todo list.

3. **recurring_todo_list.html**:
   - This will display the list of recurring todos.
   - It will have columns for the task name, due date, frequency, progress, and actions (such as mark as complete or edit).

4. **add_recurring_todo.html**:
   - This will allow users to add a new recurring todo.
   - It will have fields for the task name, due date, frequency, and progress.

5. **edit_recurring_todo.html**:
   - This will allow users to edit an existing recurring todo.
   - It will have fields for the task name, due date, frequency, and progress, pre-filled with the current values.

### Routes

1. **Homepage Route (/)**:
   - This route will render the `index.html` file.

2. **Recurring Todo List Route (/recurring_todos)**:
   - This route will display the list of recurring todos by rendering the `recurring_todo_list.html` file.
   - It will also include logic to fetch and display the recurring todos from a database or other data source.

3. **Add Recurring Todo Route (/add_recurring_todo)**:
   - This route will render the `add_recurring_todo.html` file, allowing users to add a new recurring todo.
   - It will include logic to validate the input and save the new recurring todo to a database or other data source.

4. **Edit Recurring Todo Route (/edit_recurring_todo/<todo_id>)**:
   - This route will render the `edit_recurring_todo.html` file, pre-filled with the current values of the recurring todo.
   - It will include logic to validate the input and update the recurring todo in a database or other data source.

## Additional Considerations

- The Flask application can be enhanced by adding features like user registration and authentication, allowing users to have their own accounts and manage their recurring todo lists.
- To track the progress of each todo, a database or other data storage mechanism can be used.
- To determine which tasks need more focus and which tasks are on track, the application can utilize logic to analyze the due dates, frequencies, and progress status of the todos.
